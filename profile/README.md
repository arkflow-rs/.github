This is the official GitHub organization for ArkFlow, a project dedicated to the development of a next-generation, high-performance stream processing engine engineered in Rust. The primary objective of ArkFlow is to furnish developers and enterprises with a robust, flexible, and efficient framework for real-time data processing, comprehensive analysis, and the generation of AI-driven insights.

The engine is designed for seamless integration of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities, thereby facilitating complex operations such as real-time inference, anomaly detection, and sophisticated event processing directly within data streams.

## CNCF
ArkFlow is a recognized project within the [CNCF Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?item=app-definition-and-development--streaming-messaging--arkflow).
